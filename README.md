Our work presents a simple yet effective semi-supervised approach for person re-identification. 
Note that it was just accepted by TOMM, and may take several months to appear on TOMM formally.

We only provide the GOG feature of the VIPeR dataset in the 'Features' folder. For the GOG feature of the CUHK01 dataset, please download the GOG_CUHK01.zip file from the page  http://www.i.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~matsukawa/ReID.html.
