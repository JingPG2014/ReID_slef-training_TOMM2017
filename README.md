# Enhancing Person Re-identification in a Self-trained Subspace
In this package, we provide the source code for our new paper :

Xun Yang, Meng Wang, Richang Hong, Qi Tian, Yong Rui. Enhancing Person Re-identification in a Self-trained Subspace. ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications (TOMM), 2017. (https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06020)

It presents a simple yet effective semi-supervised approach for person re-identification. 
Note that it was just accepted by TOMM, and may take several months to appear on TOMM formally.

To use this code, pls also cite the following paper:
